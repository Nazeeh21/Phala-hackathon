### Description
I have tried to develop an on chain passport, where user can add flights manually (atleast as for now) and showcase their travel history on chain. 

To provide more authenticity, we can ask users to click the live picture of tjeir whereabout and from the picture we can extract the location and add that country to the passport. This way user cant fake their location and will be able to add only those countries where they have actually been to. It will enhance the authenticity of the passport and thereby will be more reliable.

I am also planning to implement PWA for this, so that it could behave like a mobile app on iOS devices.
