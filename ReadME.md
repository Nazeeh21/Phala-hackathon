### Description
I have tried to develop an on chain passport, where user can add flights manually (atleast as for now) and showcase their travel history on chain. 

As of now, I am not asking for any proof or something and is just allowing user to add flights manually. But in future, I am planning to add a feature where user can upload their flight tickets and I will extract the flight details from the ticket and add it to the passport. This way, user will not have to add flights manually and it will be more authentic.

To provide more authenticity, we can ask users to click the live picture of their whereabout and from the picture we can extract the location and add that country to the passport. This way user cant fake their location and will be able to add only those countries where they have actually been to. It will enhance the authenticity of the passport and thereby will be more reliable.

I am also planning to implement PWA for this, so that it could behave like a mobile app on iOS devices. 

I also have plans to add a feature where user can add their friends and can see their travel history as well. This way, user can see where their friends have been to and can plan their next trip accordingly.

As of now, [aviation](https://aviationstack.com/) stack free teri api is also not providing much flexibilty so couldnt do much but with the paid tier, we can get more details. And also, due to time constraint ( I only started on monday morning) it was very much difficult to implement all the features. But I will surely implement all the features if i get to develop them. Thanks
